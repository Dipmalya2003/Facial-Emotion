# Face Emotion Detection  

**Face Emotion Detection** is a deep learning-based application designed to classify human emotions from facial expressions in real-time or static images. It utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for accurate emotion recognition.

## Features  
- **Emotion Detection**: Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality from facial expressions.  
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes video feed from a webcam for live emotion detection.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves robust performance with optimized CNN architecture.  
- **Scalable**: Easily adaptable for other facial expression-related tasks.
